                            Study's have shown crack to have amazing health benefits!<br>
                            One study condutucted by stanford university showed crack to be 100% efective in increasing energy among users.<br> With all this extra energy users found them selves to be much more productive with the average user reporting to have broken into 12.5 more cars per week to steal candy bars lying on the front seat than non crack users. All that extra energy has led to an increase in physical activity as well,<br> Crack users reported and average of running 15 police evasion miles a week, thats a little more than 2 miles a day. With all this evidence the health benifets of crack are undeniable.<br> We at the Tyrone Biggums foundation for the Rockless would like to congradulate rock smokers every where for living there healthiest life.
