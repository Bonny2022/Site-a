                        Founded by Tyrone himself the Tyrone Biggums Foundation For the Rockless is a charity organization for those experiancing rocklessness. The (TBFFR for short) has seen first hand the negative effectss rocklessness can have on a person, and a community. When asked about the situation tyrone had this to say "Sometimes things can get tough but it's important to remember the war against rocklessness is won block by block and rock by rock"
                        since that time Block by Block Rock By Rock has become the organizations slogan pledging to support the community one block and one rock at a time.
