            Tyrone was once asked to come to a school and speak to children about drugs what fallowed has earned tyrone the reputation of the most legendary drug awareness speaker off all time,<br> being asked to speak at events with audiences ranging anywhere from small local organizations to fortune 500 companys and even polititions here in the states.<br> Polititens love tyrone in fact The one thing that both republicans and democrats can agree on is that cocaine is a hell of a drug. President Bush and Tyrone became close friends during his presidency. In an interveiw President Bush reminesed about snorting cocaine off hookers titties and waking up in random allies unsure of how he got there or the events that had transpired the night before and all the other great things he did while in pursuit of a higher education, Pastimes he said he was glad to be sharing with tyrone now. Bush also stated that Tyrone is a good man who keeps it real, all americans should aspire to be more like tyrone. When asked if he thinks keeping it real could go wrong bush simply stated how could it? Apperantly he hasn't seen those episodes yet. Tyrone is now serving as the cheif advisor in bush's cabnet.
